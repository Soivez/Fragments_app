# Fragments_app
A student project app, focused on using fragments
This is a student project app in ITMO university, where we practice in using Fragments. There are 3 tabs "Home" "Dashboard" and "Notification", on which by pressing 
"OPEN NEW" button we create new Fragment of this tab. On the screen we can see the depth of these fragments opened by the button. We can move between tabs and
decrease the depth of current tab by pressing left arrow button in top left corner or simply pressing "back" button on our android device. All tabs are syncronised
and when current tab has depth equal to 1, next fragment we go is going to be a previous tab, that still has depth more than 1, otherwise we close an app.
